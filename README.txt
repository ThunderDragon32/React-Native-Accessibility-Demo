Introduction:
--------------------------------
This project is an exploration of React Native that demos 
accessiblity features of the framework and gives pass/fail 
information within the app.

This project is built using Expo Go, a development 
platform that enables seamless testing and deployment of 
React Native applications on both Android and iOS devices.


Features
--------------------------------
It will showcase the accessiblity features of the framework.
Give pass/fail information within the app.
It will serve as a good sandbox app to test the accessiblity features.


Getting Started
--------------------------------
Step 1: Install Node.js and npm
Ensure that you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system. You can download and install the latest version of Node.js from the official website: https://nodejs.org/

Step 2: Install Expo CLI
Next, install the Expo Command Line Interface (CLI) globally on your machine. Open your terminal (or command prompt) and run the following command:

bash
----
npm install -g expo-cli
----

Step 3: Clone the Project
Clone this repository to your local machine using Git or download it as a ZIP archive and extract the contents.

Step 4: Navigate to the Project Directory
Using the terminal, navigate to the project's root directory that you just cloned or extracted.

bash
----
cd path/to/your/project
----

Step 5: Install Dependencies
Install the project's dependencies by running the following command:

bash
----
npm install
----

Step 6: Launch the Development Server
To start the development server and run the application, use the Expo CLI:

bash
----
expo start
----

Step 7: Run the App on Your Device
Once the Expo development server is running, you have several options to run the app:

Scan the QR code with Expo Go app (available on Android and iOS) on your physical device.
Press a to run the app on an Android emulator.
Press i to run the app on an iOS simulator.
Step 8: Explore and Enjoy!
Congratulations! You've successfully set up the React Native Expo project on your local environment. Now, you can explore the app, interact with its accessibility features, and view the pass/fail information within the application.

Feel free to experiment, make changes, and contribute to the project to improve its accessibility and user experience. Happy exploring and coding!


Prerequisites
----------------------------------------------------------------
Before setting up and running the React Native Expo project, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed and configured on your development machine:

Node.js and npm:

Node.js is the runtime environment for executing JavaScript code outside the browser. It also includes npm, the Node Package Manager used to manage project dependencies.
Verify if Node.js and npm are installed by running the following commands in your terminal:

bash
----
node -v
npm -v
----
If these commands return version numbers, you have Node.js and npm installed. If not, download and install the latest version from the official Node.js website: https://nodejs.org/

Expo CLI:

Expo CLI is a command-line tool that allows you to create, develop, and deploy React Native applications with ease.
Install Expo CLI globally on your machine by running the following command:

bash
----
npm install -g expo-cli
----
Git (optional but recommended):

Git is a version control system that helps track changes in your codebase and enables collaboration with other developers.
If you plan to clone the project from a version control repository (such as GitHub), make sure you have Git installed and set up on your machine. You can download Git from the official website: https://git-scm.com/
Text Editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE):

Choose a text editor or IDE of your preference for writing and editing code. Popular choices include Visual Studio Code, Atom, Sublime Text, and WebStorm.
Ensure that your editor or IDE has appropriate plugins or extensions for JavaScript and React Native development to enhance your coding experience.
Expo Go App (for testing on mobile devices):

To run the React Native Expo app on your Android or iOS device, you need to install the Expo Go app from the respective app store:
Expo Go for Android: Google Play Store
Expo Go for iOS: Apple App Store
With these prerequisites in place, you are ready to set up and explore the React Native Expo project. Make sure to follow the "Getting Started" section to run the app on your local development environment and experience its accessibility features firsthand. Happy coding!
