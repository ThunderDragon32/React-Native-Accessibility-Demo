## Introduction:
--------------------------------
This project is an exploration of React Native that demos the accessibility features of the framework, providing examples of components, accessibility property use, and pass/fail information on whether the platform fully supports the accessibility feature within the app.


This project was built using Expo Go, a development 
platform that enables seamless testing and deployment of 
React Native applications on both Android and iOS devices.


## Features
--------------------------------
Accessible Component Example.
Accessible Property Use Examples.
Pass/Fail Platform Support Information.
Detecting Screen Reader Use.
It will serve as a good sandbox app to test the accessiblity features.

## Android Device App Installation
Download the application APK file from the project directory and install it on your android device.


## Getting Started (Development)
--------------------------------
Step 1: Install Node.js and npm (Node Version v20.8.0 recommended)
Ensure that you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system. You can download and install the latest version of Node.js from the official website: https://nodejs.org/

Step 2: Install Expo CLI
Next, install the Expo Command Line Interface (CLI) globally on your machine. Open your terminal (or command prompt) and run the following command:

`npm install -g expo-cli`

Step 3: Clone the Project
Clone this repository to your local machine using Git or download it as a ZIP archive and extract the contents.

Step 4: Navigate to the Project Directory
Using the terminal, navigate to the project's root directory that you just cloned or extracted.

`cd path/to/your/project`

Step 5: Install Dependencies
Install the project's dependencies by running the following command:

`npm install`

Step 6: Launch the Development Server
To start the development server and run the application, use the Expo CLI:

`npx expo start`

Step 7: Run the App on Your Device
Once the Expo development server is running, you have several options to run the app:

Scan the QR code with Expo Go app (available on Android and iOS) on your physical device.
Press a to run the app on an Android emulator.
Press i to run the app on an iOS simulator.
Step 8: Explore and Enjoy!
Congratulations! You've successfully set up the React Native Expo project on your local environment. Now, you can explore the app, interact with its accessibility features, and view the pass/fail information within the application.
